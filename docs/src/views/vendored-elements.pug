    Let's say you are including styles that are coming from a third party and do not contain any DocBlock annotations. Still, you want to see these elements in the style guide too.
  p.SG-p.
    The solution for this is quite straight-forward. Create empty dummy elements
    that match the vendored elements and put the annotations there. Since
    Nucleus is working with the SCSS source files, it is not important
    if a selector contains style declarations or not. In the end, after
    transpiling SCSS to CSS, the empty selector will not be in the CSS file.

     * vendored selector.

     * @atom Bootstrap button
     * @section Bootstrap
     * @markup
     *    &lt;button class="btn"&gt;a button&lt;/button&gt;

    .btn { /* leave empty */ }
